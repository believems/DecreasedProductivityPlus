Makes webpages more discrete.

Simply press Alt+I to enable/disable "Decreased Productivity" mode, which makes pages look more discrete. It'll also make the page look almost blank when mousing out of the window.

This addon specifically targets certain sites, which are listed below:

- messenger.com
- slack.com
- gmail.com

The script remembers whether you had it enabled or disabled for different sites each time you visit them.
